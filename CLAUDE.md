# CLAUDE.md — eduvianAI operating rules

This file is loaded automatically. The full project state, decisions, and rationale lives in [STATE_SNAPSHOT.md](STATE_SNAPSHOT.md) — read it first when you join a new session.

## What this is

Next.js 14 (App Router) study-abroad platform deployed to Vercel at https://www.eduvianai.com. Postgres + RLS in Supabase Cloud (US, Pro plan). Anthropic Claude for AI features, Resend for transactional mail, Sentry for errors. 12 destination countries, **4,622 programs / 4,413 verified at the source / 425 universities (381 with verified programs)** as of 3 May 2026, beta-gated to 100 users/month. Email OTP gates register/login.

## Hard rules — never do without explicit user approval

1. Re-add Switzerland or any country outside the 12 in scope.
2. Deploy pricing infrastructure (it was ideation only — see snapshot §6.2).
3. Push the legal pages (terms / privacy / disclaimer) — awaiting attorney sign-off.
4. Use Haiku 4.5 or Sonnet 4.6 in `scripts/verify/verify-program.ts`. Both fabricate values — Opus 4.7 only.
5. Override the `merge.ts` `TARGET_COUNTRIES` allowlist.
6. Use destructive git commands (`reset --hard`, `push --force`, `branch -D`).
7. Skip pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`).
8. Modify Supabase schema in production. Write SQL files under `src/lib/migrations/`; user runs them in Studio.
9. Lose `PII_ENCRYPTION_KEY` or `PII_HASH_SECRET` — every encrypted submissions row becomes unrecoverable.

## Communication style

- Terse, structured, factual. Tables + bullets > prose.
- Numbers always: "138 programs", not "many".
- Lead with what changed, not what's about to happen.
- Never claim something is done until verified (`git log` after a commit, `tsc --noEmit` after a code change, `ps -p` after starting a job).
- Confirm destructive ops before running.

## Ping pattern

User pings ("ping" / "status?") to check long-running jobs. Respond with: PID + elapsed, last 3 log lines, progress + ETA, anything anomalous.

## Deploy semantics

User separates "commit" from "deploy" (push). Defaults:
- Validated, prod-intended code: commit AND push.
- Drafts (legal, pricing) or items needing review: commit, **DO NOT push**.
- Always note in the response which path was taken.

## Verification pipeline (programs.ts)

The 4,295-program database in `src/data/programs.ts` is built only by `scripts/verify/`. Hard rules:

1. **No hand-authored entries.** Adds go through the pipeline.
2. **No invented values.** If the live URL doesn't state a fee/deadline/cutoff, the field is `null`.
3. **`verified_at` is sacred** — set only by the pipeline after a live fetch.
4. `field_of_study` must be one of the 17 in `FIELDS_OF_STUDY`.
5. For high-stakes programs.ts edits, prefer `repair-corruption.ts`-style parse-and-emit over inline regex. Brace walkers must track strings (history: see snapshot §4.10).
6. `verify-program.ts` stays on Opus 4.7 (audited; Haiku/Sonnet fabricate).

Tier chain runner: `nohup ./scripts/verify/chain-tiers.sh tier-N > /tmp/chain-tN.log 2>&1 &`.

## Code style

- TypeScript strict mode. `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass before commit.
- `npx next build` must pass before push (Vercel email storms otherwise).
- Imports: `@/lib/...`, `@/components/...`.
- API routes: validate input, return `NextResponse.json`, use `apiErrorResponse()` from `src/lib/api-error.ts` for failures.
- React components: function only, no classes.
- Comments: short, "why" not "what".
- Copyright trailer on every commit:

## Security posture (post-audit, 3 May 2026)

Audit document: `~/Desktop/EduvianAI-Security-Architecture-Risk-Assessment.docx`. Status:

- **All four critical** (C1 admin session, C2 submissions IDOR, C3 rate-limiter, C4 LLM injection) — closed and verified in prod.
- **All HIGH** except H7-Phase-C closed:
  - H1 admin TOTP MFA: enrolled and verified — login flow now challenges for the 6-digit code.
  - H2 opaque sessions, H3 CSRF gate, H4 DPDPA endpoints, H6 output encoding — closed.
  - H5 service-role overuse — closed-with-rationale (subsumed by C2).
  - **H7 PII encryption: Phase A + Phase B both live.** Readers prefer `profile_encrypted` and fall back to plaintext. Phase C (drop plaintext column) is the last open item; **wait at least 24-48h after Phase B ships before doing it**, take a fresh `pg_dump` first.

When working on `submissions`, both `profile` (plaintext) and `profile_encrypted` exist. Phase B is shipping; Phase C drops plaintext.

## Authentication

- Email OTP gates `/api/auth` register and login. 6-digit codes hashed with HMAC-SHA256 keyed on `PII_HASH_SECRET`. 5-min expiry, 5-attempt lockout, 60s resend cooldown. See `src/lib/otp.ts`.
- Cookie is opaque UUID (H2) → resolves via `user_sessions` table.
- `LogoutButton` clears server session + localStorage; visible on `/profile` and `/results/[token]`.
- Admin login: email + password → 6-digit MFA code → HMAC admin cookie. Server enforces AAL2 in `/api/admin/session`.
- Admin enrols MFA at `/admin/security` (QR code or manual secret).

## Key code paths

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/data/programs.ts` | THE database. **4,622 entries / 4,413 verified.** `@ts-nocheck` (large data file). |
| `src/data/db-stats.ts` | Computed counts. Now also exports `verifiedProgramsLabel` (4,413+) and `verifiedUniversitiesLabel` (381+). |
| `src/lib/types.ts` | Single source of truth. `TARGET_COUNTRIES` (12), `FIELDS_OF_STUDY` (17). |
| `src/lib/scoring.ts` | 9-signal `recommendPrograms()`. Tiers: Safe 75-100, Reach 50-74, Ambitious <50. |
| `src/lib/format-fee.ts` | Null-safe tuition rendering. **Never show $0.** |
| `src/lib/beta-gate.ts` | Per-tool monthly caps + global $50 spend cap. |
| `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` | Upstash sliding-window with in-memory fallback. Must never throw. |
| `src/lib/user-cookie.ts` | Opaque server-side sessions (H2). |
| `src/lib/pii-crypto.ts` | AES-256-GCM + emailHash for H7. |
| `src/lib/otp.ts` | OTP generate / hash (HMAC) / verify (timing-safe). |
| `src/lib/submissions-decrypt.ts` | H7 Phase B reader helper. `decryptProfile()` prefers encrypted, falls back to plaintext. Use everywhere submissions are read. |
| `src/lib/html-escape.ts` | `escHtml` / `escHtmlBounded` / `safeUrl`. Use for any user-content interpolation. |
| `src/lib/llm-safety.ts` | `wrapUserInput`, `JAILBREAK_GUARDRAILS`, `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`. Append guardrails to every system prompt. |
| `src/lib/api-error.ts` | Sentry-flushed error response. Eager Sentry init lives here. |
| `src/middleware.ts` | Same-origin CSRF gate + admin route protection. `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is the safelist. |
| `src/components/LogoutButton.tsx` | Renders only when signed in. Hits `/api/auth/logout`, clears localStorage, routes to /. |
| `src/components/DecisionDisclaimer.tsx` | In-context disclaimers on tool pages — five variants (roi, visa, english-test, shortlist, scholarship). |

## Email deliverability monitoring

- **Google Postmaster Tools** is verified for `eduvianai.com` (3 May 2026) — dashboards at https://postmaster.google.com show domain reputation, spam rate, auth pass-rate. Sparse at beta volume; check weekly. Spike on Spam Rate (>0.1%) or Domain Reputation drop = investigate before reputation tanks.
- Microsoft SNDS does NOT apply (Resend owns the sending IPs, not us). Monitor Outlook/Hotmail signals via the Resend dashboard (`complaints` count per recipient domain).
- All transactional sends include a plain-text alternative + `List-Unsubscribe` headers; OTP subject deliberately omits the code (looks like phishing to filters otherwise).

## Environment quirks

- macOS Bash 3.2 — no `${VAR^}` (uppercase first), no `${VAR,,}`, no associative arrays. Shell scripts must be portable.
- `instrumentation.ts` doesn't reliably fire on Vercel — eager `Sentry.init()` in `api-error.ts` is the actual capture path. Don't remove it.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are visible in the browser — never put secrets there.
- After deleting any `src/app/...` route, `rm -rf .next/types/app/<that-path>` before re-running `chain-tiers.sh` or it'll fail at type-check.

## Skills available

- `claude-api`, `docx`, `xlsx`, `pdf`, `pptx`
- `simplify`, `fewer-permission-prompts`, `loop`, `schedule`, `update-config`

The legal/security/pricing Word docs were generated with `docx`. Pricing Excel via `xlsx`. To regenerate legal: `node scripts/build-legal-docs.js`.

## Open work for the next session

Pinned in priority order. Snapshot §5.3 + §20 has full detail.

1. **Run re-verify on the 209 unverified entries.** `re-verify.ts` was patched with `--only-unverified` (commit landed before this snapshot). Recipe:
   ```bash
   set -a; source .env.local; set +a
   nohup npx tsx scripts/verify/re-verify.ts --only-unverified --concurrency 5 \
     > /tmp/reverify-unverified.log 2>&1 &
   # ~30-60 min. Then apply stamps:
   npx tsx scripts/verify/stamp-verified.ts
   ```
   Goal: shrink the 209 unverified gap so `verifiedProgramsLabel` on the homepage rises toward `programsLabel`.
2. **H7 Phase C**: drop plaintext `submissions.profile`. Wait at least 24-48h after Phase B has been live (Phase B shipped 3 May 2026 evening). Take a fresh `pg_dump` or use the Supabase Pro scheduled backup as the safety net first.
3. **Homepage items 2 + 8 (deferred from the homepage trust pass)**: section reorder + density cut, destinations advisory rewrite. My read at the time: cut, don't reorder. See snapshot §22 for the full discussion.
4. **Marketing email opt-in flow**: Privacy Policy §11 promises this; not yet built.
5. **Visible unsubscribe link in email body**: header is in, body link missing.

## When unsure: ask

Especially before destructive actions, schema changes in prod, or anything in the "Hard rules" list above. The cost of pausing is low; the cost of an unwanted action is high.
